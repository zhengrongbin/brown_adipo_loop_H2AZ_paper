#ALIGNER: if you have sentieon license and got sentieon installed on your machine
#Uncomment the following line and set absolute path of sentieon
#This software could speed up your alignment

#CUTOFF: Some results show that long reads do not make sense in peaks calling
#Change the number to set the cutoff

#To skip filtering, set cutoff 0 or leave it as blank

# PEAKS CALLING: Call broad peaks for some factors
# This parameter will disable motif finding modules(whatever you set or not set motif)

# macs2_broadpeaks: true


# for narrowpeak calling, extra parameters passed to macs2.

#MOTIF CALLER: if you want to use MDSeqPos, set your aligner as 'mdseqpos'

#To skip motif scanning, simply comment out BOTH lines

# FOR CISTROME DATABASE TEAM:
# Uncomment it to enable json and cistrome modules

# DEFINE the samples- each sample should have a name, e.g. SAMPLE1
# and a path to the input file, e.g. data/sample1.fastq.gz
# VALID INPUTS: fastq, fastq.gz, bam
# NOTE: for PAIRED-END fastq/fastq.gz, give both pairs to the sample:
# SAMPLE_1_PE:
#   - data/sample1_pair1.fastq
#   - data/sample1_pair2.fastq
# WARNING: DO not mix Paired-END and Single-End samples!!!
# ALSO: having the string "rep" or '.' in your sample name will throw an ERROR
# '.' causes Rscripts chop off names; and it's used as replicate splitter
